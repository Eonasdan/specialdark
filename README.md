# Special Dark Theme

**_Darkens bright pages. Love your eyes and your power bill. Check it out on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-theme-everywhere/nibjplbnmmklkfnkpecgbffkifmdbjed)._**

## Features_:
 - Ignores Code/Pre tags
 - Includes a few special site specific styles such as:
   - Facebook
   - Amazon
   - Github
   - Google's Inbox
   - Stack Exchange
   - Youtube
 - Fixed the issue with overriding the background image
 - Enables/Disables injected style sheet on toggle instead of removing the css class

I realize that Stylish exists and is useful for styling individual sites, however I think that Special Dark works well for most sites with a few exceptions.
